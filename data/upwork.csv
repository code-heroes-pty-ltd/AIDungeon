Prompt,,,
First story block,"Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were
falling like feathers from the clouds, a Queen sat at her palace window,
which had an ebony black frame, stitching her husband's shirts.","There were once three bears who lived together in a little house in the
middle of a wood. One of them was a Little, Small, Wee Bear; one was a
Middle-Sized Bear; and the other was a Great, Huge Bear.

And they each had a pot to eat their porridge from: a little pot for the
Little, Small, Wee Bear; a middle-sized pot for the Middle-Sized Bear;
and a great big pot for the Great, Huge Bear.

And they each had a chair to sit on: a little chair for the Little,
Small, Wee Bear; a middle-sized chair for the Middle-Sized Bear; and a
great big chair for the Great, Huge Bear.

And they each had a bed to sleep in: a little bed for the Little, Small,
Wee Bear; a middle-sized bed for the Middle-Sized Bear; and a great big
bed for the Great, Huge Bear.

One day they made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into
their porridge-pots, and then went out in the wood for a walk while the
porridge for their breakfast was cooling. ","Once upon a time there lived a little girl, who was so sweet and pretty
and good that everybody loved her. Her old grandmother, who was very
fond of her, made her a little red cloak and hood, which suited her so
well that everyone called her ""Little Red Riding-Hood.""

One day, Little Red Riding-Hood's mother told her to take a basket with
some butter and eggs and fresh-baked cake to her grandmother, who was
ill. The little girl, who was always willing and obliging, ran at once
to fetch her red cloak, and, taking her basket, set out on her journey.

On her way she met a wolf, who wished very much to eat her up; but who
dared not do so because some wood-cutters were working close by. So he
only said:

""Good-morning, Little Red Riding-Hood; where are you off to so early?"""
Action,looking out at the snow,go walking,replied
Result,"While she was thus engaged and looking out at the snow she pricked her finger,
and three drops of blood fell upon the snow. Now the red looked so well
upon the white that she thought to herself, ""Oh, that I had a child as
white as this snow, as red as this blood, and as black as the wood of
this frame!""","And while they were out
walking, a little Old Woman came to the house in the wood and peeped
inside.

First she peeped through the keyhole; then she peeped through the
window. Then she lifted the latch and peeped through the doorway; and,
seeing nobody in the house, she walked in. And when she saw the porridge
cooling on the table she was very pleased, for she had walked a long
way, and was getting hungry.","Little Red Riding-Hood, who did not know how dangerous it was to talk to
a wolf, replied:

""I am going to see my grandmother, who is ill in bed, to take her some
butter and eggs and a fresh-baked cake that my mother has made for her!""

""Where does your grandmother live?"" asked the wolf."
Action,came to mother,eat the porridge,answered
Result,"Soon afterwards a little daughter came to her, who was as
white as snow, and with cheeks as red as blood, and with hair as black
as ebony, and from this she was named ""Snow-White."" And at the same time
her mother died. 

About a year afterwards the King married another wife, who was very
beautiful, but so proud and haughty that she could not bear anyone to be
better-looking than herself.","So first she tasted the porridge of the Great, Huge Bear, but that was
too hot. Then she tasted the porridge of the Middle-Sized Bear, but that
was too cold. And then she tasted the porridge of the Little, Small, Wee
Bear, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right. And
she liked it so much that she ate it all up!","""In the little white cottage at the other side of the wood,"" answered
Red Riding-Hood.

""Well,"" said the wolf, ""I am going that way, too. If you will let me, I
will walk part of the way with you."" So Little Red Riding-Hood, who
suspected no harm, set off with the wolf for her companion.

Presently Red Riding-Hood stopped to gather a nosegay of wild flowers
for her grandmother, and the wolf, who had thought of a plan to get the
little girl for his dinner, said ""Good morning,"" and trotted away."
Action,said to a mirror,sat down,run as fast as can
Result,"She owned a wonderful mirror, and when she
stepped before it and said:

    ""Mirror, mirror on the wall,
     Who is the fairest of us all?""

it replied:

    ""The Queen is the fairest of the day.""

Then she was pleased, for she knew that the mirror spoke truly.","Then the little Old Woman sat down in the chair of the Great, Huge
Bear, but that was too hard. Then she sat down in the chair of the
Middle-Sized Bear, but that was too soft. Then she sat down in the
chair of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and that was neither too hard
nor too soft, but just right. And she liked it so much that she sat
in it until suddenly the bottom came out, and she fell down plump
upon the ground.","As soon as he was out of sight, he began to run as fast as he could. In
a short time he reached the grandmother's cottage and knocked at the
door.

""Who is there?"" asked the old grandmother, as she lay in bed.

""It is Little Red Riding-Hood,"" answered the wolf. ""I have brought you
some butter and eggs and a fresh-baked cake which mother has made for
you."""
Action,grew up,went upstairs,open the door
Result,"Little Snow-White, however, grew up, and became prettier and prettier,
and when she was seven years old she was as fair as the noonday, and
more beautiful than the Queen herself. When the Queen now asked her
mirror:

    ""Mirror, mirror on the wall,
     Who is the fairest of us all?""

it replied:

    ""The Queen was fairest yesterday;
     Snow-White is the fairest, now, they say.""","Then the little Old Woman went upstairs into the bedroom, where the
three Bears slept. And first she lay down on the bed of the Great, Huge
Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. Then she lay down on
the bed of the Middle-Sized Bear, but that was too high at the foot for
her. So then she lay down on the bed of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and
that was neither too high at the head nor too high at the foot, but just
right. And she liked it so much that she covered herself up and lay
there till she fell fast asleep!","""Pull the bobbin and the latch will go up,"" said the old grandmother. So
the wolf pulled the bobbin and opened the door, and sprang upon the poor
old grandmother and ate her all up in a twinkling.

Then he put on her night-cap and got into bed, and lay down to wait for
Red Riding-Hood.

Very soon there came a little soft tap at the door. 
â€œWho is there?"" called out the wolf.

""It is Little Red Riding-Hood, grandmother dear. I have brought you some
butter and eggs and a fresh-baked cake which mother has made for you.""

Then the wolf called out, disguising his voice as much as he could:

""Pull the bobbin and the latch will go up."""
Action,got angry,sleeping,go inside
Result,"This answer so angered the Queen that she became quite yellow with envy.
From that hour, whenever she saw Snow-White, her heart was hardened
against her, and she hated the little girl. Her envy and jealousy
increased so that she had no rest day or night, and she said to a
Huntsman, ""Take the child away into the forest. I will never look
upon her again. You must kill her, and bring me her heart and tongue
for a token.""","By and by the three Bears came home to breakfast. Now, the little Old
Woman had left the spoon of the Great, Huge Bear standing in his
porridge pot.

    ""=Somebody has been at my porridge!=""

said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.

And when the Middle-Sized Bear looked, she saw that the spoon was
standing in her porridge-pot too.

    ""=Somebody has been at my porridge!=""

said the Middle-Sized Bear in her middle-sized voice.

Then the Little, Small, Wee Bear looked, and there was the spoon in
his porridge-pot; but the porridge was all gone.

    ""=Somebody has been at my porridge and has eaten it all up!=""

said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.","So Little Red Riding-Hood
pulled the bobbin and went inside.

[Illustration]

""Good morning, dear grandmother,"" she said. ""How are you feeling today?""

""Very bad indeed, my dear,"" answered the wolf, trying to hide himself
under the bedclothes.

""How strange and hoarse your voice sounds, grandmother,"" said the little
girl.

""I have got a bad cold, my dear,"" said the wicked wolf."
Action,try to kill her,look about them,ask about eyes
Result,"The Huntsman listened and took the maiden away, but when he drew out his
knife to kill her, she began to cry, saying, ""Ah, dear Huntsman, give me
my life! I will run into the wild forest, and never come home again.""
","Then the three Bears began to look about them. Now, the little Old Woman
had not put the hard cushion straight after she had sat in the chair of
the Great, Huge Bear.

    ""=Somebody has been sitting in my chair!=""

said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.

And the little Old Woman had squashed the soft cushion of the
Middle-Sized Bear.

    ""=Somebody has been sitting in my chair!=""

said the Middle-Sized Bear, in her middle-sized voice.

And you know what the little Old Woman had done to the third chair.

    ""=Somebody has been sitting in my chair and has sat the bottom out!=""

said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.","""Grandmother, what very bright eyes you have!"" went on Red Riding-Hood,
surprised to see how strange her grandmother looked in her nightclothes.

""The better to see you with, my dear,"" said the wolf."
Action,run away,went upstair into their bedroom,ask about ears
Result,"
This speech softened the Hunter's heart, and her beauty so touched him
that he had pity on her and said, ""Well, run away then, poor child."" But
he thought to himself, ""The wild beasts will soon devour you."" Still he
felt as if a stone had been lifted from his heart, because her death was
not by his hand. Just at that moment a young boar came roaring along to
the spot, and as soon as he clapped eyes upon it the Huntsman caught it,
and, killing it, took its tongue and heart and carried them to the
Queen, for a token of his deed.","Then the three Bears went upstairs into their bedroom. Now, the little
Old Woman had pulled the pillow of the Great, Huge Bear out of its
place.

    ""=Somebody has been lying in my bed!=""

said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.

And the little Old Woman had pulled the bolster of the Middle-Sized Bear
out of its place.

    ""=Somebody has been lying in my bed!=""

said the Middle-Sized Bear, in her middle-sized voice.

And when the Little, Small, Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was
the bolster in its place, and the pillow in its place upon the bolster;
and upon the pillow was the little Old Woman's head, which was not in
its place, for she had no business there at all.

    ""=Somebody has been lying in my bed--and here she is!=""

cried the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.","""Grandmother, what very big ears you have!""

""The better to hear you with, my child."""
